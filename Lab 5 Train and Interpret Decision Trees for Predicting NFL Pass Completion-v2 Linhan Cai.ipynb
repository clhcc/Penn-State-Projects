A file that stores data in CSV format uses \".csv\" as its file extension.  \n\n### Read_CSV in Panda\nThe easiest way to read a CSV file for the purpose of constructing a predictive model is to use read_csv function in Panda. The function reads data from a CSV file, and generates a table-style internal representation (called DataFrame).\n<ul>\n    <li> The first parameter of the function is the name of the csv file to be read. </li>\n\n    <li> The \"sep=\" parameter in read_csv specifieds the separator of different fields.  Because the CSV file used for this lab uses comma (i.e., \",\") as separator, the read_csv function has \"sep=\",\" as the second pamater. </li>\n    \n</ul>"

Because pass prediction model for each quaterback can be different, so this dataset is prepared for the purpose of predicting the outcome of passing play by Steeler quaterback Ben Rothlisberger. The last column of the CSV file contains the outcome of each passing play.\n\nIn general, the data for building a predictive model involves two types: \n<ol>\n    <li> The input data to the model (which we also call FEATURES), and </li>\n    <li> The DESIRED prediction output data of the model (for each corresponding input) </li>\n    </ol>\nTogether, these data are used to \"train\" the model, as we shall see later, so that the model's output,\ngiven each input, is AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE (we will elaborate this point later) to the DESIRED output.\n\nFor example, the data for training to predict pass completion includes input data for the prediction (e.g., distance of pass, number of down, yards to go, etc), and the DESIRED output of the prediction (i.e., whether a pass plays completes or not). \n\nThe meaning of all the input attributes/features for this lab are listed below:\n<ul>\n    <li>down: The number of down for the play</li>\n    <li>ydstogo: The remaining yards needed to gain for a first down</li>\n    <li>Yards.Gained.PrevPlay: The number of yards gained in the previous play (which can be a run play or passing play}</li>\n    <li>AirYards: The distance between the starting position of the play and the receiving position of the passing play. A negative number means the quarterback moves back in the play such that the net yardage gain, if the pass completes, is negative. </li>\n    <li>PassLocation: The area of passing location: -1 means left field, 0 means center field, 1 means right field. </li>\n</ul>\n\nThe value of the desired prediction output (i.e., PassOutcome in the last column) in the dataset indicates whether the outcome of each passing play, represented by each row, is completes (i.e., having the value \"1\") or incomplete (i.e., having the value \"0\").

A negative number means the quarterback moves back in the play such that the net yardage gain, if the pass completes, is negative. </li>\n<li>PassLocation: The area of passing location: -1 means left field, 0 means center field, 1 means right field.</li>\n    </ul>\n\nIn DataFrame, the first column is referred to as column \"0\" (rather than column 1).  Therefore, the columns of the table-like representation stored in Ben_pass are:\n<ul>\n    <li> The column\n        storing the value of \"down\" is column 0. </li>\n    <li> The column storing the value of \"ydstogo\" is column 1. </li>\n    <li> The column storing the value of \"Yards.Gained.PrevPlay\" is column 2. </li>\n    <li> The column storing the value of \"AirYards\" is column 3. </li>\n    <li> The column storing the value of \"PassLocation\" is column 4. </li>\n    <li> The column storing the value of desired model output \"PassOutcome\" is column 5. </li>\n    </ul>\n\nTo extract column 0, 1, 2, and 3 from Ben_pass (which stores the table-like representation), we use \"0:4\" to indicate a range of columns from column 0 to (but NOT including) column 4.  The method we use to extract these columns is \"values\".  The first parameter of values (colon, \":\"), indicates that we are extracting ALL Rows.  Together with the second parameter \"0:4\", the method values[:, 0:4] indicates we are extracting column 0 to column 4 for all rows of the table-like representation stored in Ben_pass.  \n\nWe store the extracted input data in a variable called X.\n\n#### Notice that we do not want to extract column 5 because it contains the desired model output, so we want to save it in a different variable to prepare for model training (which takes model input data and desired model output data separately)."

This means that we are NOT going to use this reserved data to train the model.  THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT and we will return to it later for a more detail look.  For now, we will focus on the workflow for constructing a predictive model.\n\nThere are multiple ways to use data to train decision tree models.  We will use train_test_split Python command from sklearn Python module. In the beginning of this lab, we have imported train_test_split from sklearn as follows:\n\n    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nImporting a function from a library means we can directly use this function after the import.\n\nTrain_test_split has four parameters:\n<ol>\n    <li> The first paraemter is all of the model's input data. We have prepared variable X1 to be used here. </li>\n    <li> The second parameter is all of the model's target output data.  We have prepared variable Y to be used here. </li>\n    <li> The third parameter (test_size) is the percentage of the data (both model input and output) to be RESERVED for testing.  We use 25% here, and will revisit this topic later. </li>\n    <li> The fourth paraemter (randome_state) is a random number to be used to randomly split the model's input and output data (i.e., the data stored in variable X and variable Y) into two subgroups: a Training Set and a Testing Set.\n    </ol>\n\nThe output of the train_test_split function includes four inter-related results:\n<ol>\n    <li> The Model Input Data (features) used for Training: We store this in the variable X_train </li>\n    <li> The Model Input Data (features) used for Testing: We store this in the variable X_test </li>\n    <li> The Model Output Data (prediction) used for Training: We store this in the variable y_train </li>\n    <li> The Model Output Data (prediction) used for Testing: We store this in the variable y_test </li>\n    \n    </ol>"

Create an \"empty\" Decision Tree Classifier by specifying the various parameters we use to construct the decision tree. Save the created empty Decision Tree Classifier in a variable (e.g., \"clf\" in the code below) for the next step. Some of the important parameters are the following:\n    * criterion: We will use 'entropy' as the criteria for creating decision trees in this class.  \n    * max_depth: This parameter specifies how \"deep\" the decision tree is allowed.  If you choose \"max_depth=3\", the tree created will be limited to 3 levels. (The root node is at level 0.) As we will see later, the choice of this parameter can affect the model's risk for overfitting.\n    * min_samples_leaf: This parameter specifies the minimum number of samples required in a leaf node. As we will see later, the choice of this parameter can also affect the model's risk for overfitting.\n2.
